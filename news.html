										<p><strong><br />
												<font size="3">What brings you to the area: </font><br />
											</strong>The Withlacoochee trail is what brought my 10 year old son and me to the area. It was a long anticipated visit - and it will not be our last visit.</p>
										<p><strong><font size="3">How did you find our trail: <br />
												</font></strong>The overall experience was great in all respect. The trail was amazing, the Central Motel in Inverness was a pleasure, the countryside of gentle rolling hills is attractive, the people in the towns along the trail friendly - in short all really good. I was prior to the ride a little concerned about the mention on various reviews about the lack of shade. However, we went in the middle of August and found plenty of shade as we were riding. The trail is in perfect shape and obviously well cared for. We thank all the people involved in the maintanence process. Thank you.</p>
										<p><font size="3"><strong>What improvements would you like to see: <br />
												</strong></font>My number one problem prior to deciding to do the trail was related to logistics. I knew my son could do the trail one way, but not both ways. So I tried a long time to find a someone to bring our bikes to Owensboro and the beginning of the trail. But no luck. However, with persistence, I did succeed getting help from one small taxi company in Inverness: Chris Taxi. Chris is a delightful man, not in a rush and very caring. He brought us and our bikes to Owensboro and made the visit possible. Without his (or somebody else) help, we would not have visited the trail. I'm positive there are many others, considering a trip to the trail, but not doing it because of the logistics. This is an important part of the experience and once transportation can be arranged it should open a door to others as well. </p>

										<p align="center"><i>-Florida&rsquo;s longest, state rail-trail recognized for local and regional significance</i>-</p>
										<p><b></b></p>
										<p><b>TALLAHASSEE</b> -The Department of Environmental Protection&rsquo;s (DEP) Office of Greenways &amp; Trails is proud to announce that the Withlacoochee, Inc. State Trail has been designated as a National Recreation Trail (NRT).&nbsp;This popular rail-trail, managed by the DEP Office of Greenways &amp; Trails,&nbsp; joins an elite list of more than 1000 trails across the United States that are considered exemplary for their local and regional significance, based on criteria established by the National Recreation Trails program.</p>
										<p>The 2011 NRT trails were officially announced in conjunction with National Trails Day,&reg; which is sponsored annually by the American Hiking Society, on June 4, 2011.&nbsp;In announcing the 2011 NRT designations, U. S. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar said,<em> &ldquo;We are very proud of these trails and the spirit of partnerships and resource conservation that they represent.&nbsp; Trails provide millions of Americans with healthy recreational experiences and often their first encounters with the natural world.&rdquo;</em> National Recreation Trails are components of the National Trails System and recognize existing trails that connect people to recreational resources and improve their quality of life.&nbsp;</p>
										<p>&ldquo;We welcome this national recognition for an outstanding trail that is a significant resource for the state and an engine for Florida tourism,&rdquo; said Jim Wood, Assistant Director of the DEP Office of Greenways &amp; Trails.&nbsp;&ldquo;Due to its length and linear design, this Trail helps support the economy of a number of small towns and communities across a three-county area.&rdquo;</p>
										<p>In 2010, nearly 300,000 trail users enjoyed the great recreational opportunities offered by this 46-mile rail-trail which runs through Citrus, Hernando and Pasco counties, along the path of a former CSX railroad corridor from Citrus Springs to six miles north of Dade City. The Withlacoochee State Trail (WST) is a paved, multi-use trail, with a parallel, unpaved equestrian trail that runs alongside portions of the corridor. As it traverses small towns, ranches and six distinct natural communities, the WST offers rich opportunities for viewing wildlife.</p>
										<p>The trail&rsquo;s neighboring communities clearly value this resource as the counties and towns have developed trail-related features and businesses, as well as side trails that access the WST. Rails to Trails of the Withlacoochee, Inc. (RTW), a 400&#150;member, citizen support organization, has worked to enhance and raise funds for the WST for more than 16 years. The group has restored a 1925 caboose that serves as a landmark for the Inverness Trailhead, purchased a large, maintenance building structure, installed interpretive signage along the Trail and&#151;in cooperation with the Citrus County Health Department&#151;developed a health and fitness circuit alongside the Trail, added covered picnic tables, benches, restored the historic whistle posts and mileage markers, installed a gazebo overlooking Inverness pool, and built a pavilion with benches at the Citrus Springs trailhead. In 2010, the RTW volunteers contributed 9,600 hours in support of the Trail and annually hosts what is believed to be the largest one-day bike ride in the Southeast, attracting over 1500 participants. The organization helps inform trail users and attract visitors to the WST through its website, railstotrailsonline.com, which received high honors as American Trails&rsquo; 2010 winner of the best website by a &ldquo;Trail organization or club.&rdquo;</p>
										<p>Florida has been named by American Trails as &ldquo;Best Trails State in America,&rdquo; recognizing the efforts of DEP&rsquo;s Office of Greenways &amp; Trails (OGT) and its many partners for their coordinated efforts to establish Florida&rsquo;s statewide system of trails.&nbsp; OGT provides community assistance, trail acquisition and development funding, and public outreach to expand the statewide system of greenways and trails.&nbsp; OGT also manages eight state trails and the Marjorie Harris Carr Cross Florida Greenway.&nbsp; The Greenway is Florida&rsquo;s longest green corridor stretching 110 miles from the St. Johns River near Palatka to the Gulf of Mexico near Inglis.&nbsp; Of the eight state trails, six are rail-trails, which are railroad corridors converted to recreational trails for hiking, biking, skating, equestrian activities and alternative transportation.</p>

										<p><b>Special to The Washington Post<br />

										<p>They were the words this weekend cyclist with fortysomething bones, and a twentysomething spirit, longed to hear: &quot;City Girl is handling the trail pretty well.&quot;</p>
										<p>&quot;City Girl&quot; was the nickname I'd earned from my fellow riders after biking along a leg of Florida's 46-mile Withlacoochee Trail. Perhaps they'd doubted my prowess because of the grimace I had failed to conceal when they told me how far we'd be riding that day (30 miles!). Truth be told, biking the flat, well-groomed path wasn't difficult at all, but deciding which of Central Florida's bicycle trails to pedal had been.</p>
										<p>Within an 80-mile radius of Orlando, there are five paved trails 16 miles or longer. Two more lie just a tad beyond that. Since I could devote only three half-days to a ride, I opted to limit myself to one locale.</p>
										<p>Should I amble along the Pinellas Trail on the Gulf Coast? It starts in the velvety green fishing village of Tarpon Springs and meanders south for 34 miles to St. Petersburg. Or could I cover the grueling, 29-mile straightaway through the sun-baked Green Swamp on the Van Fleet Trail? Maybe I should choose an easier 29-mile course along the Suncoast Parkway Trail north of Tampa -- or try out Orlando's newly extended 19-mile West Orange Trail near Walt Disney World.</p>
										<p>Nope, I decided. Even though I'm only a recreational rider -- my usual jaunt is 14 miles along Washington's Capital Crescent Trail -- I opted for Florida's longest-paved path, the Withlacoochee, Inc. Trail State Park, which follows two defunct 1890s railroad lines.</p>
										<p>I longed to pedal and pedal and pedal. And that's just what I accomplished, setting a personal best by biking that 30 miles the first day. With the path seldom rising above a six-degree grade, I never felt a bit of pain.</p>
										<p>I was also drawn to the trail because much of it is isolated from Florida's tourist-trodden circuits, and it boasts a Wild West flavor from its turn-of-the-century boom towns. Plus, it cuts through the 154,368-acre Withlacoochee State Forest, dubbed by the World Wildlife Fund as one of the &quot;Top 10 Coolest Places You've Never Seen in North America.&quot;</p>
										<p>The Withlacoochee -- which takes its name from an Indian word meaning &quot;crooked river&quot; -- seems to retreat through time. Its northern trail head appears firmly planted in modern-day Florida, beginning in a somewhat Fellini-esque setting of asphalt roads plotted through empty lots in a housing development. Toward the trail's midsection, the landscape -- with its 1960s-era towns -- starts to resemble Old Florida. Finally, in the cowboy community at the trail's southern end, time has downright stood still: Trilby, with its pink wooden church and petite post office, appears unfazed by 21st-century worries and Disney, a little more than an hour east.</p>
										<p>Although I was staying at a friend's house near the northern trail head, I began the first day of my excursion closer to the Withlacoochee, Inc.'s midpoint in Inverness. I joined a bike group headed by Chris Trangos and Ken Spilios, members of Rails to Trails of the Withlacoochee, Inc., the nonprofit association that helps maintain the path.</p>
										<p>Nearly every Thursday morning, the group invites riders to wheel along with them from Inverness to Istachatta, a teeny outpost of about 65 residents along the banks of the languid Withlacoochee River. Typically they chow down on biscuits and gravy or other rustic fare at Istachatta's General Store and then loop back. Although their trek attracts the occasional tourist, it's mainly residents, retirees and snowbirds who ride the out-of-the-way trail.</p>
										<p>This 15-mile stretch is the trail's busiest point, as bikers share the lane with in-line skaters, walkers and the occasional baby stroller. Virtually the entire 12-foot-wide asphalt pathway, which is fashioned with thousands of recycled tires, is handicapped accessible, including most of the picnic pavilions along the way.</p>
										<p>Inverness is the biggest &quot;city&quot; on the trail. Its 1912 courthouse-turned-museum, with its copper-topped cupola, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Elvis Presley filmed part of &quot;Follow That Dream&quot; here in the summer of '61.</p>
										<p>As we pedaled away from the brick courthouse, one of my fellow riders startled me.</p>
										<p>&quot;Most wildlife shies away from you,&quot; Spilios said.</p>
										<p>&quot;What kind of wildlife lives here?&quot; I inquired fretfully as I watched the trail-side houses start to dwindle.</p>
										<p>&quot;You could possibly see an alligator right on the side,&quot; he responded with a grin. Rattlesnakes, armadillos and an endless bevy of birds live here, too. (I never did run into a gator while riding, but I did bump into one that evening at Stumpknockers, a restaurant on Inverness's town square, known for its gator steaks and crispy fried gator nuggets.)</p>
										<p>During the 30-mile round trip that day, the scariest thing I spied was a flock of wild turkeys dawdling under moss-drenched oak trees. I also saw gobs of tortoise burrows, though I escaped any brush with the snakes and other creepy critters that share their dens.</p>
										<p>The next day during another 30-mile ride, though, I did encounter something scary.</p>
										<p>While my friend and I were biking alone on the remote southern leg of the trail, which swings through cattle ranches and the Withlacoochee, Inc. Forest, we learned that hunting is permitted on either side for roughly a dozen miles. In the midst of the forest, Iowan Walt Doyle, his wife and another couple on bikes stopped dead in their tracks when they spotted signs cautioning riders about the hunting zone.</p>
										<p>&quot;We reversed our course because of it,&quot; said Doyle, a hunter himself. &quot;We voted 4 to 0 against continuing.&quot;</p>
										<p>Although I was also wary of any cowboy who might be aiming his shotgun my way, it wasn't enough to stop me because I was mesmerized by the procession of sunshine-yellow wildflowers, milky-white plum blossoms and soothing green cabbage palms.</p>
										<p>I did, however, broach the subject later with trail manager Harry Mitchell, especially because I didn't see any signs proclaiming hunting dates. He assured me that the path is safe and that hunters are barred from carrying loaded guns across it. &quot;We've never had any incidents,&quot; he said.</p>
										<p>As it turns out, that part of central Florida boasts a gun-toting Wild West legacy. Nearby San Antonio still hosts an annual rattlesnake festival, and not too far northeast of the trail is where federal agents blasted Ma Barker out of her hideout on Lake Weir in 1935. The entire region was once the site of a roaring phosphate boom that briefly rivaled California's bawdy Gold Rush days. The 1890s boomtowns spawned the railways that the Withlacoochee, Inc. Trail now follows: Henry B. Plant's line linking Georgia to Tampa, and the phosphate-mining freight trains of the Silver Springs, Ocala and Gulf Railroad Co.</p>
										<p>On the final day of my trip, I toured parts of the northern leg of the trail, stopping briefly in Hernando. It reminded me of the sleepy villages I knew as a kid traipsing through inland Florida in the 1960s.</p>
										<p>If I return to the trail next year, I plan to take a dip in Hernando's lake alongside the great blue herons and coots. I'd also like to camp beside the Withlacoochee, Inc. River and paddle its 83-mile canoe trail.</p>
										<p>But for now, City Girl needs a little time to rest.</p>
