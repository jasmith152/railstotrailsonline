		<p><strong>Floral City to host barbecue cookoff-</strong></p>
		<p>Floral City plans to put itself on show this fall with a new event: Floral City Bikes and Barbecue Cook Off.</p>
		<p>Pam Bellman, organizer for the Floral City Merchants Association, applied last week for special project funding from the Citrus County Tourist Development Council.</p>
		<p>The event would be set for Oct. 1. Its primary objective would be to offer an activity the Saturday before Sunday’s annual Rails to Trails Bike Ride in Inverness to encourage bike riders to arrive a day earlier.</p>
		<p>“Floral City’s unique blend of history and quaint shops will appeal to visitors,” Bellman wrote in the application. “Floral City is a jewel in Citrus County. New visitors find it very appealing.”</p>
		<p>The merchants’ association projects the event will attract between 3,000 and 5,000 visitors who would spend about $100 apiece. It would appeal to recreational bicycle riders, motorcycle enthusiasts and families.</p>
		<p>The application requested $2,500 funding for advertising.</p>
		<p>The new event also was brought up at the Agricultural Alliance of Citrus County at its July meeting. Dudley Calfee, manager of Ferris Farms and member of the merchant’s association, said in addition to a barbecue cookoff, the event would feature music and vendors.</p>
		<p>Calfee has built a bike trail connecting his retail store to the Withlacoochee, Inc. trail, which has benefited Floral City merchants.</p>
		<p>In other business:</p>
		<p>* Marla Chancey, director of the Citrus County Visitors and Convention Bureau, requested $2,000 in funds to update and reprint the brochure: “Recreational Harvesting of the Florida Bay Scallop.” It needs updated images and updated general map locator. The Sea Grant Program from University of Florida will pay half the cost for 15,000 brochures.</p>
		<p>* Don Hess, who is concerned about the restoration of King’s Bay, volunteered to work with government leaders and stakeholders to develop solutions to aid wildlife, manatees and recreational users.</p>
		<p>* Jim Eyster, owner of Chassa Oaks RV Park, reported the volume of revenue RVers bring to Citrus County. He concluded half of the $600,000 bed tax comes from RVers and would like to see more targeted advertising placed on RV camping in Citrus County. Eyster is to advise on reaching the widest audience.</p>
		<p>* A motion was passed to send a letter to state Sen. Charles Dean, state Sen. Mike Fasano and state Rep. Jimmie T. Smith to ask the Florida Department of Revenue to explain its method of compiling revenue collection for Citrus County, as the TDC needs this information to develop its budget.</p>
		<p>* Roger MacDonald, chief marketing officer with Scout Capital, new owner of Plantation on Crystal River, said the company has a plan for renewal with major capitol improvement.</p>
